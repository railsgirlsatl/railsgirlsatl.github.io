## Speak at an Event

Rails Girls Atlanta holds a [monthly meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Rails-Girls-Atlanta/) where we have a speaker or two present to the group on code or culture or hold a mini workshop and we’re always open to sharing or reviewing each other’s code. Contact us at railsgirlsatl[at]gmail[dot]com if you're interested in speaking at an event, we'd love to hear from you.

## Become A Mentor

Rails Girls Atlanta Mentors give back to our community by donating their time. We believe in the [Dreyfus Model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition) of skill acquisition so all skill levels are welcome to mentor. To learn more about mentoring opportunities contact us at railsgirlsatl[at]gmail[dot]com!

## Sponsor Meetups and Workshops

Meeting sponsorship for one month is $250 to cover the cost of food and refreshments for attendees. Benefits of sponsorship include mention & logo on the meetup page, mention from our Rails Girls ATL twitter account and opportunities to speak at our meetup. Less immediate benefits for sponsors include building a good relationship with a group of self-motivated, developing developers. As above, contact us at railsgirlsatl[at]gmail[dot]com for more information.
